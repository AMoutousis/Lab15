            <h3>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h3>
            Here you can find a few projects I've worked on and a brief description about them.
            <br>

            <a href="https://github.com/LFryman/Space-JALS-Gyms">First, is my midterm assignment about a fictional gym called Space JALS Gyms. </a>
            <br>
            <br>
            This project was a midterm designed to challenge us and think in OOP. The project was a lot of fun to work on because we expressed our creativity by making our gym in space but also successfully made a OOP project!

            <a href="https://github.com/AMoutousis/BlockbusterLab">Second, is a lab assignment called Blockbuster</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            In this assignment, we made a fictional Blockbuster that allowed users to watch movies that we created. This project was fun because I made up my own movies!
