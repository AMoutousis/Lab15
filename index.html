            In my freetime, I enjoy coding, playing video games, reading and watching horror movies!

            Growing up, I was always interested in computers. Years ago, I was talking with an old friend about how I was unhappy with my pre-dental classes and was thinking about changing my major.
            Knowing that I was interested in computers, he showed me some projects he had done in his freetime. From that moment on, I was in love with programming.
            Over the next few days, I researched what being a Software Developer was like then spoke with my advisor at school about changing majors. After that, I switched my major to Information Systems Management!
            The program taught me a lot about computers and programming. From there, I got my first job in IT and used my skills to develop some great solutions for the companies that I worked for! 
            <br>
            <br>
            I can't wait to start learning and become a professional Software Developer!
