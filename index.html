        <p><h1>Hi! My Name is Andoni!</h1>
            <br>
            This is what I look like!

            In my freetime, I enjoy coding, playing video games, reading and watching horror movies!

            Growing up, I was always interested in computers. One day an old friend of mine was talking to me about his Computer Science classes and they sounded very interesting!
            I researched what being a Software Developer was like and after a few days, spoke with my advisor at school about changing majors. After that, I switched my major to Computer Science!
            While I did not end up getting a degree in Computer Science, I switched to Information Systems Management, the love of programming stayed with me throughout my career, 
            which is what brought me to Grand Circus!
            <br>
            <br>
            I can't wait to start learning and become a professional Software Developer!
